This project is an interactive dashboard designed to monitor Year-over-Year (YoY) sales trends, customer loyalty tiers, and inventory risks in real-time. It uses SQL for data querying, integrates with Azure SQL Database, and includes automation for daily scheduling. Built with open-source data to simulate real-world e-commerce analytics.

The dashboard helps businesses forecast sales, identify loyal customers, and mitigate inventory issues, providing actionable insights for decision-making.

## Features
- **YoY Trends**: Visualize sales growth over time with line charts and growth percentages.
- **Customer Loyalty Tiers**: Segment customers into tiers (e.g., High, Medium, Low) based on purchase frequency.
- **Inventory Risks**: Real-time alerts for low-stock or overstock items to prevent losses.
- **Automation**: Daily scheduled queries using Python, integrated with Azure DB for seamless updates.
- **Interactivity**: Slicers, drill-downs, and filters in Power BI for dynamic exploration.

## Dataset
This project uses the open-source [Superstore Sales Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting). 
- **Why this dataset?** It includes sales transactions with dates, customer details, products, quantities, and profitsâ€”perfect for YoY analysis, loyalty segmentation, and inventory tracking.
